-PA stands for programming assignment
-CS 121 is a UChicago python class I took in fall 2021
-This is not the class repository, but rather one I created seprarately for the purpose of showing examples of my work to potential internship recruiters
-as you can tell, the repository only contains codes I wrote (no supplementary documents or helper functions for the respective projects)
